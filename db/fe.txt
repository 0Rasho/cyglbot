Earth is Yahuwah's Footstool: Matthew 5:35 "Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King."

The (1) Firmament/Dome/Vaulted Dome, and expanse created thereby and upon where God’s throne exists: Genesis 1:6-8, Genesis 1:14-18, Genesis 1:20
For we are told in Psalm 19:1, “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.” A man who is determined to undermine the scriptural proof of the firmament, undermines the handywork of God.
Genesis 1:6-8 – With understanding the properties of water, it requires a physically hardened substance to keep it contained. Thus, a dome/firmament is not only logical, but is within the proper context of scripture.
